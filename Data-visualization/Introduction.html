              <p class="lead mb-40">This research explores how to choose heroes for the popular online eSport game Dota 2. As a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (Dota), Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game has the highest prize pool among all types of eSports competitions. As of November 15, 2019, the total prize pool of Dota 2 International has reached $34,330,068, making it the most lucrative game in E-sport (Dota 2 Prize Pool Tracker 2019).</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">The game is played in matches between two teams of five players; one team will play as Radiant, and the other team will play as Dire. Each team occupies and defends its respective base on the map, and the team that destroys the other team’s ancient building (known as “Ancient,” located within each team’s base) wins the game. Each player controls one of the 117 characters (known as “heroes”). Once a player chooses a hero, other players cannot select that same hero for the same match. Heroes have their unique strengths and weaknesses based on their skills and characteristics. Different combinations of heroes in a team will have different interactions, ultimately yielding a variety of match outcomes. </p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">Hero selection, also known as drafting, is so crucial to the game that carefully designed hero choices can “implicitly give a team a large advantage before the match even begins” (Conley and Perry 2013). As Dota 2 is a team game where every player has to play specific roles according to every situation, picking good heroes for every role while ensuring these heroes fit well together is essential to guarantee a team’s victory (Dota 2 Freaks 2021). The majority of professional players already have a predetermined game plan before entering the drafting phase; for game analysts and commentators, predicting drafting decisions is one of their main topics during the broadcast of a match’s drafting phase (Summerville, Cook, and Steenhuisen 2016).</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">By combining data visualization and neural network machine learning, this project seeks to help players choose heroes to maximize a team’s likelihood of victory. I will start by introducing some game-play terms. I then visualize key statistics of heroes and interpret how to use these visualizations to choose heroes. Next, I use a basic neural network machine learning model to predict a team’s match outcome (win/lose) based on their hero choices. Finally, I evaluate my project and discuss what needs to be done in the conclusion section.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;" >Lanes</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">When a player starts to choose a hero, the player first needs to decide which lane he/she is trying to play. A lane is one of three paths (the Top line, the Middle line, and the Bottom line) that leads from one team’s Ancient (base) to the other (see Figure 1). When the game starts, the lane creeps (non-player characters) will push along these lanes (Dota 2 Wiki 2018). Players need to kill these creeps to obtain gold  and experience points and destroy defense towers while approaching the enemy base in these lanes (eSportsGuide 2021).</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">Depending on the distance between the natural creep equilibrium (where the two creeps initially meet up) and the Tier 1 defense tower, these lanes are also known as the safe lane and the hard lane. The safe lane is the one with the shortest distance so that it is easy for a laning  hero can retreat to their tower’s protection. By contrast, a team’s safe lane is the hard lane for the enemy team, as it is difficult for enemies to sneak through the jungle and gank  the laning hero (Dota 2 Wiki 2018). For example, for team Radiant, the bottom line is their safe lane, whereas it is the hard lane for team Dire. In general, a team will choose a hero with better survival abilities for their hard lane and let their most important player play the safe lane.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Positions</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">There are five positions in each team, with 1 indicating that the player has the highest farm  gold priority and 5 having the lowest. At the early stage of the game, a team usually has one player focusing on the safe lane, and this player is known as the Position 1 hero. Position 1 hero needs to have good farming abilities to gather enough gold quickly. With gold, Position 1 heroes can buy items that give the hero extra abilities. The hero will become the strongest hero later in the game if the team gains a significant gold advantage. </p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">To make sure the Position 1 hero farms safely and is not disturbed by the enemy, a team usually has a support hero following the Position 1 hero on the safe lane, whom we call the Position 5 hero. Because the amount of gold is finite, the support hero will not farm gold. Instead, the support hero usually picks more spells and uses their abilities to gain an advantage for the entire team.</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">In the middle of the game, a team usually encounters a situation when the amount of gold is not enough to sustain its heroes. Thus, it is essential for the Position 4 hero to farm gold for the team when other heroes have no time to acquire gold in the mid-game. Position 4 heroes are also responsible for supporting heroes in other lanes and ganking the enemy.</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">Position 2 heroes usually play the middle line. As the middle line is usually a 1v1 situation, Position 2 heroes need strong skills to dominate a 1v1 situation and can farm enough gold to upgrade skills quickly. Heroes in this position are chosen for their farming abilities and ganking abilities, which are reflected in their GPM (gold per minute) and XPM (experience per minute). Due to these reasons, there are not many options for Position 2 heroes.</p>
              <p class="lead mb-40">The last position is Position 3. Position 3 heroes usually play the hard lane. Sometimes, the Position 4 support hero will help the Position 3 hero in the hard lane; more often, the Position 3 hero is solo in the hard lane. Therefore, the Position 3 hero’s primary focus is to survive and farm gold when possible. Heroes in this role are required to have a set of survival skills and can be upgraded by the hero’s items.</p>
